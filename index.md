Welcome to my homepage!

I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from Tsinghua University. I am engaged in independent postdoctoral research at the Department of Land Economy, University of Cambridge.

My research focuses on <font color=red>**Mathematical Approaches for Classical Political Economy**</font>, Marxian Economics and Post-Keynesian Economics.

I also have interests in the topics on China’s Economy and the methods of Spatial Analysis.

I am committed to analyzing problems and proposing solutions from the perspective of Political Economy while promoting a critical and constructive dialogue with Mainstream Economics.
