    “Production Structure, Income Distribution and Macroeconomic Efficiency: An Analytical Framework and Empirical Study of Marxist Political Economy” (in Chinese)
    ***Economic Research Journal*** [**TOP** Chinese Journal in Economics], 2019, 54 (3): 181-193 [[ERJ2019](http://39.98.141.84:3838/iMarxTool/ERJ2019.pdf)]

    **Abstract**: In the current literature, there is little systematic research on the relationship among adjustment of the income distribution, change in economic structure and improvement of macroeconomic efficiency. This paper expands Marx's reproduction schema into the “Marx–Sraffa” three-department structure table comprising fixed capital, general means of production and means of consumption and employs China's input–output table from 1987 to 2015 to portray the relationship between income distribution and macroeconomic efficiency under investment-driven growth. This paper calculates the wage–profit curve of China's economy and evaluates the space of macroeconomic efficiency improvement in China based on the deviation between actual and potential income distribution structure. The results show that there is a downward trend of the profit rate, which meets Marx's theoretical prediction, and the decline in the profit rate is mainly attributed to an increase in the organic composition of capital arising from the rapid growth of fixed capital investment under extended growth. The analysis of macroeconomic efficiency shows that the space for improving macroeconomic efficiency is extremely limited under traditional growth pattern and that China must transform its economic development pattern and foster new economic growth drivers.

    “The French Regulation School: Core Concepts, Theoretical Evolution and Enlightenment” (in Chinese)
    ***China Review of Political Economy***, 2022, 13 (6): 146-174 [[CRPE2022](http://39.98.141.84:3838/iMarxTool/CRPE2022.pdf)]

    **Abstract**: Born in the economic crisis and crisis in economics in the 1970s, the French Regulation School (FRS), theoretically inspired by Marx and other radical economists, advocates studying the capitalist mode of production (CMP) as a historical process with the “Regulation Approach” as a leading paradigm. It is of great significance to examine the achievements and new progress of the FRS. This paper reviews the core concepts and theoretical evolution of the FRS from the perspective of Marx's economics. We find that the institutional forms, mode of regulation, and accumulation regime jointly determine the capitalist economy's self-regulation, self-renewal, and self-development, where five types of crises are also involved. There is a strong continuity of studies among scholars of different generations. The transformation from Fordism to Post-Fordism and exportism as a dominant mode of growth in the East Asian newly industrializing economies (EANICs) has attracted the attention of scholars in the 20th century while emphasizing the central role of the state in regulation is an essential theoretical turn in the 21st century. Regarding methodology, the FRS pays attention to complementary economic and extra-economic mechanisms, integrated micro and macro perspectives, historical induction, and contradiction analysis, all of which have rich reference significance for the innovation of Marxist economics.
